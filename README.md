# OMDB-api-search-by-title
Search movies by title using the OMDB api.  Click on a movie image to go to it's IMDB page.

I combined most of what I have learned about Express.js so far:

I use app.css in the public directory to include CSS for every page (a few lines in app.js and header.ejs).

The views directory contains the EJS files for the home page and result pages.

The partials directory within views contains EJS partials for the header, footer, and search form.

I created this project using goormIDE
